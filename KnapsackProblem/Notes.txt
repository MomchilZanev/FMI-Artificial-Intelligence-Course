Kanpsack tips:
- always generate valid bags

crossovers:
- like one-point crossover: take one part of one bag and anether part of second bag and get new bag
- like uniform crossover: (? iterate through cells and if there is element place it, otherwise dont ?) generate indices 0 - N-1, shuffle them and check if element is present, if yes put in child bag until full, if cannot place current element, check next

mutations:
- remove something from bag, put something else in
